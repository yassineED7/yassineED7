```

âœ… **Features of this version:**  
- Minimal, clean, and professional style.  
- Clear sections: About Me, Tech Stack, Projects, GitHub Stats, Contact.  
- Markdown compatible with GitHub README.  
- Keeps personality but removes excessive animations or GIFs.  

If you want, I can also make a **modern professional version with skill badges** to make it look more **visual and appealing** while keeping it professional.  

Do you want me to do that next?
```
